## Linux File Hierarchy

The Linux file system follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

```
/ : The root directory and the starting point of the file system.

/bin : Contains essential system binaries such as ls, cat, cp, mv, etc.

/boot : Contains the files required for booting the system, including the Linux kernel, initrd images, and boot loader configuration files.

/dev : Contains device files, which are used to communicate with hardware devices.

/etc : Contains system-wide configuration files such as network settings, user accounts, and system services.

/home : Contains user home directories.

/lib : Contains system libraries required by programs on the system.

/mnt : Mount point for temporary file systems such as external hard drives, USB drives, etc.

/opt : Contains optional software packages that are not part of the core system.

/proc : Contains virtual files that provide information about the system's hardware and running processes.

/root : Home directory for the root user.

/sbin : Contains system binaries used for system administration tasks.

/tmp : Directory for temporary files.

/usr : Contains files related to user applications, including binaries, libraries, documentation, and source code.

/var : Contains variable files such as log files, mail spools, and temporary files generated by system processes.

## Working with files in Linux

`$ touch <filename>` : Create Empty files.

```
    touch f1.txt
    touch a.txt b.txt c.txt d.md
```

`$ cat` : Create files with content and print file contents. (Overwrite/write/append)

```
    cat > filename   : Create file with data   (ctrl + d to close the file)
	cat >> filename  : Append data to existing file
	cat  filename   : Print file content
	cat filename1  >  filename2  : Copy data from filename1 to filename 2
    cat filename1 filename2 > filename3  : Copy data from filename1 and filename2 to filename3.
	cat  f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt  : Copy more than one file data into another file

```

> **_NOTE:_**: If the file does not exists, `cat` command will create a file itself.

`$ tac` : The 'tac' command is the reverse of the 'cat' command. It is also known as 'cat' backward. It will display the file content in reverse order.

```
        tac <filename>
```

`$ mv` : Move/Rename the files.

```
    mv current-name new-name
```

`$ rm` : Remove the files.

```
    rm <filename>
```

`$ rm*` : Remove all the files under a loacation at once. 
```
    rm *
```


## Working with Directories in Linux

`$mkdir` : it is used to create/make directory.

`$rmdir` : it is used to remove only empty directory.

`$rm -r  <dirname>` : It is used to delete non-empty directories.

`$rm -i  <dirname>` :  `-i` flag will ask for confirmation `yes or no ?` before deletion.

`$cd <dirname>`  : Change directory

`$cd ..`  : Come out from the directory

`$ls -l <dirname>` : list the content of given directory

`$cat <filename>`   : It will display all the data available in the file

`$head`  : It will display first 10 lines of the file  from top  (`10` is the default count)

			head  <filename>  (it will give first 10 lines of data)
			head  -n  15 <filename>     (it will give first 15 lines of data)
			head  -n  25 <filename>   (it will give first 25 lines of data)

`$tail`   :  It will display last 10 lines of the file from bottom (10 is the default count)

                tail  <filename>   (it will give last 10 lines data)
                tail -n 15 <filename>   (it will give last 15 lines data)
                tail -n 25 <filename> (it will give last 25 lines data)

                tail -n 50 <filename> (it will give last 50 lines data)
                tail -n +50 <filename> (it will give data from 50th line to till last line)
            
> **_NOTE:_**: To get latest data from file we need to use 'tail' command because lastest data will be appended at bottom
