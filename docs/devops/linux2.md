The Linux file system follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

```
/ : The root directory and the starting point of the file system.

/bin : Contains essential system binaries such as ls, cat, cp, mv, etc.

/boot : Contains the files required for booting the system, including the Linux kernel, initrd images, and boot loader configuration files.

/dev : Contains device files, which are used to communicate with hardware devices.

/etc : Contains system-wide configuration files such as network settings, user accounts, and system services.

/home : Contains user home directories.

/lib : Contains system libraries required by programs on the system.

/mnt : Mount point for temporary file systems such as external hard drives, USB drives, etc.

/opt : Contains optional software packages that are not part of the core system.

/proc : Contains virtual files that provide information about the system's hardware and running processes.

/root : Home directory for the root user.

/sbin : Contains system binaries used for system administration tasks.

/tmp : Directory for temporary files.
